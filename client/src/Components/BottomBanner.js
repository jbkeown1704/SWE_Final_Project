// Okay, let's build the bottom banner component. It's a simple part of the UI,
// but it needs to handle a couple of key things: logging out and showing a tutorial.

// I'll need `useState` to manage the state of the tutorial modal, and `useNavigate`
// to handle the logout button's click.
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

// This is the component for the bottom banner.
function BottomBanner() {
  // Initializing my navigation hook.

  // A state variable to control the visibility of the tutorial modal. It's hidden by default.

  // This function is called when the user clicks the "Tutorial" button.
  // It simply flips the state to `true` to show the modal.
  const handleTutorialClick = () => {

  // This function is called when the user clicks the "Close" button inside the modal.
  // It sets the state back to `false` to hide it.
  const handleCloseTutorial = () => {

  // Here's the UI for the banner. I'm using a React Fragment (`<>...</>`)
  // because I need to return more than one top-level element (the banner and the modal).

            <h2>A Friendly Guide to Your Dashboard! üó∫Ô∏è</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome! This dashboard is your central hub for disaster reporting and event management. Here‚Äôs a quick guide to get you started:
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>View the Map</h3>
            <p>
              The map on your dashboard shows a smaller view of an area. To get a closer look, click the **"Expand Map"** button. This will take you to a full-screen view where you can see more details.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Join a Disaster Event</h3>
            <p>
              If a disaster event has already been created, you can join it by clicking **"Join Disaster Event."** A pop-up will appear where you can enter the unique event code to access the specific map and reports for that location.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Create Your Own Event</h3>
            <p>
              To create a new event for a specific disaster, click **"Create Event Password."** You can set a unique code, and, if you know them, enter the latitude and longitude coordinates. This will create a new, dedicated event for others to join.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>See What's Happening</h3>
            <p>
              The **"Alerts"** section lists all reports from the event you're currently in. You'll see a small emoji and a preview of the report message. This helps you quickly see what's happening on the ground.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Enjoy exploring and stay safe!
            </p>
