            <h2>A Friendly Guide to Your Dashboard! üó∫Ô∏è</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome! This dashboard is your central hub for disaster reporting and event management. Here‚Äôs a quick guide to get you started:
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>View the Map</h3>
            <p>
              The map on your dashboard shows a smaller view of an area. To get a closer look, click the **"Expand Map"** button. This will take you to a full-screen view where you can see more details.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Join a Disaster Event</h3>
            <p>
              If a disaster event has already been created, you can join it by clicking **"Join Disaster Event."** A pop-up will appear where you can enter the unique event code to access the specific map and reports for that location.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Create Your Own Event</h3>
            <p>
              To create a new event for a specific disaster, click **"Create Event Password."** You can set a unique code, and, if you know them, enter the latitude and longitude coordinates. This will create a new, dedicated event for others to join.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>See What's Happening</h3>
            <p>
              The **"Alerts"** section lists all reports from the event you're currently in. You'll see a small emoji and a preview of the report message. This helps you quickly see what's happening on the ground.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Enjoy exploring and stay safe!
            </p>

    </>
  );
